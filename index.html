            Hi my friends, I'm Winnie the Pooh. <br/>
        </p>
        I need to write this work for school, but what I realy prefer to do is sleeping.
        I realy love sleeing, sleeping is the best way to spend the day. Sleeping and eating honey!
        I realy love honey! And meeting with my friends Tigger, Eeyore and Piglet.
        But well, sometimes you have to do things you don't want to...<br/>
        <br/>
        I realized that even when I do so, I sometimes learn new things, about me and about the world and how it works.
        For example, last semster I learned about Artificial Intelligence. It's very interesting. Thinking about
        all the problems it can solve, and all the models we can build, and all the methods of learning.
        It's not interesting like meeting with Tigeer and chasing after bees, but it's interesting somehow... <br/>
        <br/>
        I have some course expectations. The first one is not sleeping during the lesson. It's not because the
         teacher or teaching assistant,  god forbid, it's because of my loving for sleeping! The second one is to learn new skills in html, css, javascript and other methods and language that will
        help me to explor the world. Last but not list, I expect that at the end of the semster all of us will celebrate with honey cookies, honey cakes,
        honey shakes and lots of pure honey!<br/>
        <p>
            That's it guys, I hope you'll enjoy my website!

      We have some questions we need to answer:
    </p>
    <article>
      <ol type="A">
        <li id="QA_text">
          <b>List 3 differences between web1, web2 and web3:</b>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
                <u>Static Vs Dynamic</u> - Web1 allows only static pages. It means we as consumers of the page can't enter any new data or information to the page.
                For example, we can't add our phone number to make contact or any other personal detail. On the other hand, at web2 and web3 the web pages is way
                more dynamic. We can enter new data that can help us achieve more goals, contribute information of their own in existing sites and share 
                information with new pepole like in social networking sites (facebook and twitter for example).
            </li>
            <li>
              <u>Personal & information pages Vs service pages</u> - Because of the properties above, The use of the pages in web1 differ frome the use of pages
                  in web2 and web3. While the pages in web 1 are more personal and informative pages, where people can mostly read informafion from,
                  pages in web2 and web3 can provide variety of services to the consumers like Virtual campuses and online courses, online governmental services,
                  simple electronic health services and much more services. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <u>Importance of network anaylisis</u> - While in web1 and web2 the improtnece of network analysis wasn't very high, web3 allows us to make
              different analysis that can help the web's costumers to make good decisions despite the huge amount of data in the web. Some of the methodes includes
              analysis of trend in the web, semantic search, API, machine learning & NLP and more.

          <b>Example of a use-case: searching for a recipe of a honey cacke!</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
                <u>Web1</u> - I will find different pages of recipes, some of them will be old and not that modern. If I'd like to chose differnt options like gluten
                free honey cake in the same page I woun't be able to do so...   
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Web2</u> - I will find different pages of recipes, blogs of pepole who made thier own honey cake, facebook pages of pastry-cooks and professional
                web sites that specialize in honey cakes. In a specific page, a could chose options of ingredients that I would like to include in my cake, like 
                raisins, and I'll get filtered list of honey cakes with raisins!
            </li>
          <li>
              <u>Web3</u> - I will find different pages of recipes, blogs and professional web sites that specialize in honey cakes. In addition, I'll get links to
              pages about "Rosh Hashsna" (my favorite holiday!), names of recommended restaurant with the best honey cakes, coffeehouses near me that sell honey 
              cakes, cross-checking of things that I looked for in the past (like Eeyore or Tigeer) with honey cakes and much more other things.
